# KIE Server OptaPlanner Task Assignment
An example of assigning tasks on KIE Server using OptaPlanner.

## Requirements
- JDK 1.8 or above
- Maven 3.0+
- node.js 8.12+
- npm 6.4.1+
- [WildFly](https://download.jboss.org/wildfly/11.0.0.Final/wildfly-11.0.0.Final.zip)
- KIE Server war file from [OptaPlanner website](http://www.optaplanner.org/download/download.html) (Execution server -> Any application server, unzip to find the war file)

## Running the demo
### First start a WildFly instance and deploy KIE artifacts:
- Download and unzip the WildFly distribution. Letâ€™s call the root of the distribution WILDFLY_HOME. This directory is named after the WildFly version, so for example `wildfly-11.0.1.Final` is the one we're using for this demo.
- Download kie-server-...-ee7.war and place it into `WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/deployments` as `kie-server.war`.
- Configure user(s) and role(s). Execute the following command `WILDFLY_HOME/bin/add-user.sh -a -u 'kieserver' -p 'kieserver1!' -ro 'kie-server'`. You can of course choose different username and password, just make sure that the user has role `kie-server`
- Start the server by running `WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml`. The default URI for KIE Server is `http:/localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server`. Check this location in a web browser to verify the server is running. You will be prompted to type in username and password, use the ones you chose when adding a new user.

### Now that the KIE Server is running, let's deploy an OptaPlanner service to solve a task assignment problem.
- Copy the OptaPlanner service kjar to your local mvn repository, this can be done by typing the command `mvn install` in `kie-server-optaplanner-task-assignment/task-assignment-kjar`.
- Run the UI:
  - Go to `kie-server-optaplanner-task-assignment/task-assignment-ui`
  - `npm install` to install the dependencies.
  - `npm start` this will start the frontend application. If it doesn't open in a default browser, open your favorite browser and go to `localhost:3000`
